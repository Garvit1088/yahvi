            I know sometimes I am unable to give you the love that you want for that particular time but darling I miss you every second, every minute, every hour and every day..<br>
            You are the 1st and the last thought of my day.. and I can not express all my feelings in words for you.<br><br>

            *6 is just a number...* but I felt the happiest in this 6 months only because of you... I know lots of problems were also there at the starting.. but I am thankful of god as you are with me today.. <br>
            I still remember that nervousness I had while proposing you but everything happened for a reason.<br><br>

            *Bade baba* ke ashirvad se hi tum mile ho mujhe... maine tumhe *Kundalpur* me hi propose kiya tha.. par bade baba ne mujhe ashirvad me *goddess jaisi ladki* dedi. <br>
            Jo mera itna khayal rakhti h mujhe itna special feel karwati h.. *You are my 1st and last love, my darling...* ❤<br>
            And once again, *happy 6th month anniversary my love.*<br><br>
